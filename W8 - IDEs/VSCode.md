# Introduction to Visual Studio Code

From the beginning of this course we have been using IDLE (Interactive Development and Learning Environment), a program that comes installed with Python. This is an example of an IDE, or an Interactive Development Environment, specialized for use with Python exclusively. As you continue in your CS courses, you may have to work with other languages and so getting used to another IDE early on could be useful. \
All code that you write is just text on some file, and IDEs are essentially just a text editor with some nice features. If you have been finding IDLE to be clunky, a very popular and easy to use IDE is Visual Studio Code, or VS Code. This week we will cover just enough of VS Code to get you comfortable programming with it.

## Installing VS Code
VS Code is available for all common platforms and can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Getting Set Up
To get you started, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-s71n0dHUk&t=81s) and the first 17:30 minutes of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FltByLPnrg).

If you're still used to thinking in terms of script mode and interactive mode, IDEs primarily work in "script mode", where you are editing files that can be saved and run. To run a script/python file, just press the &#x25B6; button on the top right. An equivalent to an interactive mode is to just run Python in a terminal. You can bring up a terminal in VS Code by pressing Ctrl + \`, or Cmd + \` on Mac. Then type in `python`, hit Enter, and you should see a prompt allowing you to type in Python code one line at a time like how you were able to in IDLE.


## LiveShare
In the video for setting up Python in VS Code, you should have seen how to install an extension for Python. Now, the reason why I chose to focus on VS Code. A really useful extension for when you are pair programming on your projects will be the LiveShare extension. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2ceblXTBBc) for an introduction to LiveShare. Try it out with your partner.
